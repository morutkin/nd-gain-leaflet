All data files are downloaded in one zipped file. The zip file contains nine independent files that reflect data used to generate each of the hazard scores and forecasts and the primary data at the city level and sub-city level (census tract). The latter two data files comprise the raw data used in the modeling for vulnerability, exposure and readiness scores, recorded in their raw format. All data are in CSV files.Each file has a common city, state and geographic identifiers (GEOIDs) variable that permits easy identification and merging, if necessary. Each hazard file contains primarily the modeled scores for risk and readiness, but also the historical data for deaths and property loss for a given hazard/city. The steps required to go from the raw data to the models scores are described in the technical document; the command file is accessible through the technical document.Our sub-city data are within the file “Sub City Indicators”, and are assigned a unique GEOIDs to each census tract but have a common identifier to its corresponding City Level data, using GEOIDs and CITY ID, city and state names. There are 25,500 census tract observations in our 278 cities. The data primarily come from the US Census Bureau. However, GIS analysis were performed at sub-city level to compute the variables that are not from the census (e.g., tree canopy cover, impervious surface, FEMA etc.). For more information, please visit the Methodology section: https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/urban-adaptation/methodology/
